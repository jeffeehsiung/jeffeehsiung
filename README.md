### About Me 📘
I'm a passionate developer and researcher with a keen interest in researching and developing state-of-the-art algorithms and deep learning models in **Computer Vision, Computer Architecture, Quantitative Research, and Electrical Engineering**. 🖥️🔍  

### Education 🎓
- Master’s and Bachelor's Degree in Electronics and ICT Engineering from KU Leuven  
- Key interests: Deep Learning, Model Architecture & Explainability, Mathematics, Computer Vision, Digital Signal Processing, Image Signal Processing, Accelerators, Statistics, and all things Signals.

### Projects 🛠️
- **Meta-PCT Models for Wafer Inspection (Applied Materials, Taiwan)**  
  Developed generalizability-focused tabular/patches Meta-PCT models for multi-stage domain feature engineering and optical wafer inspection anomaly detection at the 2nm node.  
  Architected a full EDA-based pipeline (filtering, denoising, feature engineering, segmentation, detection, classification) optimized for sensitivity–throughput trade-offs.  
  Achieved major performance gains: **F1 score 0.297 → 0.78**, **Precision 0.174 → 0.74**, **Recall 0.8 → 1.0**.  
  Collaborated with applications, systems, and software teams to integrate algorithms into large-scale production systems.

- **Interferometric ISAR for Person Identification (IMEC)**  
  Designed a novel **Interferometric Inverse Synthetic Aperture Radar (ISAR) 3D imaging algorithm** for non-cooperative target reconstruction across FMCW MIMO radar setups.  
  Implemented 2D-FFT, image autofocusing, radial motion compensation, interferometry for 3D angular refinement, and JPDA EKF for multi-target tracking.  
  Fused multi-channel 2D ISAR images into Doppler-aligned high-quality 3D point clouds as input to a **PointNet++-based Few-shot Transformer**, achieving:  
  - **2–14× improvement** in height measurement performance vs. existing methods  
  - **95%+ accuracy** in person identification  
  Optimized computation via PyTorch data parallelism, CUDA kernels, vectorization, multiprocessing, and multithreading.

- **Lane Detection LiDAR**: Processed LiDAR point cloud data without machine learning to detect and mark the ego lane. Used mathematical/statistical preprocessing, cubic polynomial regression with RANSAC-based inlier/outlier classification.  
- **Adaptive Notch Filter**: Implemented in C and Assembly on the C5515 platform as part of R&D coursework at KU Leuven.  
- **Adventure_Quest_C++**: Designed a C++ pixel-art style game emphasizing extendability via polymorphism and MVC pattern. Switchable graphics/text representation. 🎮 (Nov 2023 – Dec 2023)  
- **Pet Facial Expression Recognition**: Classified pet emotions with Transfer Learning (EfficientNet) to enhance human-pet interaction. 🐾🤖 (Oct 2023 – Dec 2023)  
- **Spatial Room Impulse Response for Dynamic Auralization**: Built dynamic SRIR datasets and continuous binaural auralizations for VR spatial sound. 🎧 (Oct 2023 – Dec 2023)  
- **Baby Monitoring System**: Cry detection and environmental monitoring to prevent Sudden Infant Death Syndrome, using spectral and temporal domain features. 👶🔊  
- **Large Integer Arithmetic Hardware Accelerator**: Optimized a multi-precision hybrid adder for efficient 512-bit arithmetic operations. 🧮🚀
