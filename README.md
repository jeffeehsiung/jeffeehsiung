### About Me 📘
I'm a passionate developer and researcher with a keen interest in Computer Vision, Computer Architecture, and Electrical Engineering. 🖥️🔍 

### Education 🎓
- Master’s and Bachelor's Degree in Electronics and ICT Engineering from KU Leuven
- Key interests in Digital Signal Processing, Image Signal Processing, Computer Vision, Accelerator, and Deep Learning

### Projects 🛠️
- **Lane Detection LiDAR**: The assignment involves processing LiDAR point cloud data without machine learning to detect and mark the ego lane. It uses mathematical modeling and statistical methods for preprocessing and filtering. Lane markings are detected from the filtered data, ego lane grids are marked, and lanes are modeled using a cubic polynomial regressor. The regressor's fitting points are selected via RANSACRegressor for classifying inliers and outliers.
- **Adaptive Notch Filter**: The is a lab assignment for the Research and Developemnt course of KU Leuven, where an adaptive notch filter is developed in both C and assembly on the C5515 platform.
- **Adventure_Quest_C++**: Design a C++ graphis pixel-art like game focusing on extendability by employing polymorphism and employing MVC design pattern. Grpahics and Text-based representation dynamically switchable 🎮 (Nov 2023 - Dec 2023)
- **Pet Facial Expression Recognition**: Classify your pet's emotion with our model! Enhancing human-pet interactions with ML Transfer Learning EfficientNet. 🐾🤖 (Oct 2023 - Dec 2023)
- **Spatial Room Impulse Response for Dynamic Auralization**: (submitting to journal). Dynamic SRIRs datasets & continous binaural auralizations for moving Listener, developed for immersive VR spatial sound reproductoin 🎧 (Oct 2023 - Dec 2023)
- **Baby Monitoring System**: Developed a system for cry detection and environmental monitoring to avoid Sudden Infant Death Syndrone by exploiting spectral and temporal doman features. 👶🔊
- **Large Integer Arithmetic Operations Hardware Accelerator**: Improved a multi-precision hybrid adder for efficient large operands (512 bits) arithmetic operations. 🧮🚀

### Skills 💼
- **Languages**: Verilog, Python, C, C++, Java, Assembler, SQL
- **Technologies**: TensorFlow, FPGA
- **Tools**: omg there is a lot...

### Experience 🌱
- Currently working at @imec as a master thesis student, focusing on 3-D radar imaging algorithm development. 🏢💼
- Participated in various team projects and leadership roles, enhancing both my technical and interpersonal skills. 👥✨

### Contributions & Community 🌍
- Actively contribute to open source projects related to computer vision.
- Active in tech communities and always eager to collaborate on innovative projects. 🤝💬

### Fun Facts 🎈
- I love amimals. Most of the software and hardware I developed based on the motivation of improving the lives of 🐈🐕🦭🦁🐅🐘🦝🐁🐿️🦊🐄🐎🦄<br>
